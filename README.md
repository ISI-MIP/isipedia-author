## About the template

The [template](template.md) is intended to provide authors with a reference to draft
their ISIpedia articles, both in terms of structure and suggested texts
as well as to prepare the graphical materials. We encourage authors
planning to write text articles to contact the Editorial Team in the
first place (*Barbara Willaarts, Jens De Bruijn, Barbara Templ and Mah√©
Perrette via* <isipedia.editorial.team@pik-potsdam.de>) to have a
pre-discussion on the topic, type of contributions, etc.

Following the initial discussion, and if the author would like to
prepare a text article, we recommend the author to use this template,
although its use is NOT compulsory. Authors experienced in science
communication are encouraged to develop free-format articles, under the
premises that: 1) the resulting text complies with the [guidelines for
authors](https://demo.isipedia.org/for-authors/) as described in the
ISIpedia portal; and 2) the authors carefully read and follow the
instructions on how to prepare the graphical materials ( see Section 2).

ISIPedia articles can be divided into two broad categories: 1)
individual contributions e.g. country-based studies, and 2) global
contributions with gridded information that can be further breakdown
into national reports. Authors aiming to prepare the latest type of
articles should bear in mind that a given number of sections will remain
the same across all national reports, namely sections on (see Section 1
for details) 1) How to interpret the results; 2) limitations and
knowledge gaps; 3) data and methods, and 4) references. Only the key
messages section, as well as the main findings, will be adjusted to each
country and global report.

*NOTE: ISIpedia contributions are not just restricted to text articles.
We also welcome other types of contributions such as infographics, video
interviews, etc. Authors willing to provide contributions other than
written articles please contact the editorial team.*
