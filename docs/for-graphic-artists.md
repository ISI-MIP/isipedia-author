subtitle: Call for help in raising awareness of the impact of climate change
covertext: |
  It is our mission to make the latest climate impact research accessible to the public. To this end we invite joint author teams to distill the societal relevant messages from their scientific publications into ISIpedia articles that will enable citizens, stakeholders and policy makers to take informed decisions in light of climate change. Articles could provide relevant information about future risks, address observed changes in natural or human systems and their attribution to climate change but also inform about the latest progress in these processes.

This is basically a call for help regarding the translation of our scientific papers into ISIpedia visualisations, videos or other formats that are easily accessible to the public.
As we are scientists, we may not have the best feeling of what is easily understandable to the public and it would be great to collaborate with the experts in visual and science communication.

We would also like to make ISIpedia quite divers regarding formats. So each scientific article that should be translated into an ISIpedia information could become a small project where you could work together with an individual author (or a small group of authors) to ensure a good translation.

See also the info for [science communicator](../for-communicators/) for a list of papers or other contributions we would like to integrate into the website and where the scientists behind have already expressed their interest in the collaboration with you as the communication experts. Feel free to contact the editorial team if you were interested to help with one of these projects. Then we will put you in contact with the authors!

Looking forward to your ideas!

When planning to contribute to ISIpedia or you have any questions, please get in contact with the Head of the editorial team, Dr. Barbara Templ via email: isipedia.editorial.team@pik-potsdam.de .
