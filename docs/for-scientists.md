  ISIpedia is a science communication tool to make the latest climate impact research accessible to the public. To this end we invite author teams to distill the societal relevant messages from their scientific publications into ISIpedia articles that will enable citizens, stakeholders and policy makers to make informed decisions in light of climate change. ISIpedia articles should provide relevant information about future climate-related risks, address observed changes in natural or human systems and their attribution to climate change, but also inform about the latest progress in the development of climate impact models.

In general, we assume a setting like this: a scientist has analyzed the ISIMIP2a/2b data with an interesting outcome that is worth to be published in a scientific journal. Given the relevance of the topic, the author also wishes to disseminate the research outcomes beyond academia to reach the general public. The information below offers insights to authors on how they can make their science available in the ISIPedia portal. 

The first step an author should take when planning to contribute to the ISIpedia portal is to approach the editorial team (Barbara Willaarts, Jens De Bruijn, Barbara Templ and Mahé Perrette via isipedia.editorial.team@pik-potsdam.de). This first discussion will help defining the type and scope of the contribution, as well as inform the author on how the editorial process works. Contributions to the ISIPedia portal can take different formats: short text articles highlighting the key messages of the original published research, videos, interviews, etc. The author is free to choose the type of contribution, and the ISIPedia editorial team will provide advice on how to develop the different types of contributions. 


## What are the requirements for making your research available on ISIPedia portal? 

First and most important, each ISIpedia article requires a peer-reviewed paper in the background. The preparation of the ISIpedia article can start before the scientific paper is published, but the final online publication of the ISIpedia article would be conditional upon publication of the related scientific paper.

If the authors choose to develop a text article, the following considerations need to be taken into account:

- There is no fix format. Typically, an ISIPedia article will have an extension of 5-6 pages, and include the following sections: Key messages, Main findings (including 1-2 relevant figures, see below instructions for graphical maerials), Knowledge and information gaps, and brief summary on the data used, methods and main assumptions. The Editorial team has develop a simple [template](/assets/doc/Template-SIpedia-Text-articles.docx') that authors might wish yo use in case they need guidance. 

- Use a direct style when writing and bear in mind that you need to communicate your findings to an audience that is not always  familiriazed with very technical terms. Avoid technical jargon and standard scientific writing. 

- The graphical material is key to convey clear messages. The editorial team can provide advice on what visualization options are available and best ways to summarize often very complex information, but authors need to consider in the first place: “What is your main take-home message you would like to highlight”, “Can I explain everything what is displayed on the plot?”.

- Choice of area/region: we would prefer having assessments at national level because users may prefer country-wise assessments since they are more meaningful in the political decision-making progress. However, if you feel that the message of your contribution is rather useful, better explainable at a specific region / continent-level, please feel free to do so. If you are uncomfortable with evaluating the results at region/continent-level, because you are an expert at your nation`s level, please write only about your chosen country. If your scientific paper is a global study based on gridded data that cab ne break down to country level,  the Editorial team can provide the technical support for an automatic generation of national aggregated values and Figures. In this case, the ISIpedia article will be written as one “master document” providing the information that is identical across all countries (definition of the indicator, underlying data processing, restrictions of the method etc.).

- Within the ISIpedia portal, articles will be labeled according to three assessment categories (“future projections”, “model evaluation”, “detection and attribution of observed impacts”), the geographical location (country, group of countries, world), and the name of the indicator or topic discussed. Sub-national information shall be labeled under the encompassing country.


## Final checklist before start writing your ISIpedia article.

1. Is there a published/submitted paper (using ISIMIP 2a, 2b protocol) underlinning the contribution you wish to make?
2. What is the main message you would like to highlight?
3. Which area you would like to focus on? 
4. Is the text writen in a plane language i.e. easily understandable for non-technical audience? 
5. Are you ready to engage with experts in science communication to explore creative ways of disseminating your research?
