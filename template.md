## How to interpret results

\[2-5 short paragraphs where the author provides the reader with the key
necessary information to later understand the results i.e. definition of
the indicators or variables used to present the results, and key
assumptions underpinning the results. If the article is about model
evaluation, what human/natural processes these models simulate, and what
is the meaning of the output variables\]

> ### Why global hydrological models?

> Managing water resources sustainably as well as minimizing the risks
linked to water-related hazards such as floods requires a good
understanding of how water flows within a basin, how it is managed and
used by different sectors and economic activities, as well as what are
the potential risks of human settlements near the watercourse.

> Hydrological models emerge in response to the above mentioned societal
challenges. The scale of their application largely determines the
purpose of these models. While at regional scales hydrological models
can be useful for short to medium term planning, global hydrological
models play an important role in informing global policies and
evaluating the water-related impacts associated with different
socio-economic and climate related challenges in the longer term.

> ### How to represent human impacts and transformation of water flows in models?

> Human activities have caused substantial modifications of freshwater
ecosystems e.g. building dams for storage, diverting water for economic
uses, and on the surrounding terrestrial ecosystems e.g. developing
human-built settlements on or near water courses or shifting natural
ecosystems into agricultural areas. These changes have substantial
implications in the way water flows within the territory, by altering
the amount, quality and timing of the streamflow. Parametrizing these
human impacts into global hydrological models is key to improve the
representation and simulation of the hydrological response within large
catchments. The human impact parameters (HIP) considered in this work
were implemented in the modeling routines of five-state-the-art models
(H08, LPJmL, MATSIRO, PCR-GLOBWB, and WaterGAP2), and refer to:

> 1.  Dam and reservoir operations

> 2.  Socio-economic water uses, specifically water demands by
    agriculture (irrigation and livestock), industry and domestic.
    Evaporation rates of the water tables in dams is also measured in
    some models

> 3.  Land use and land cover changes

> ### What performance are we measuring?

> Hydrological performance means how good a model is able to represent
the real hydrological functioning of a basin. The less the models
outputs deviate from the real measurements, the better the model
performs.

> The measurement of model performance in this study relates to two main
aspects:

> 1. **Hydrological extremes** are unusual high- and low- river flows 
with low probabilities of occurrence. High flows in this paper are
equivalent to extremely high discharges that are only seeing 1% of
the times based on the historical records of 100 months. These
flows are linked to floods. Low flows are equivalent to extremely
low discharges that are only seen 1% of the times based on the
historical records of 100 months. These flows are associated with
the so-called hydrological droughts. The metric used in this study
to measure the capacity of models to simulate high- and low flows
is an efficiency criteria, whose values can range between -∞ and
+1. Maximum efficiency is achieved when the fitted values match
1:1 with observed and efficiency metric is equal to +1. Values
below 1 indicate that models are less able to predict high or low
flows.

graphical material please read Section 2, and get in touch with the
Editorial team if aiming for interactive figures. If the type of article
permits, we would like you to include both the absolute and relative
change to the indicator under the effect of climate change as well as
the effect on the population.\]

> Today the land area affected by landslides per year amounts to x%
of the total global/country land area. In the RCP 2.6 scenario, x% of
the total global/country land area is projected to be affected by at
least one flood in 2050 (xx that of today's world). Under the RCP6.0
scenario the global/country land area affected by at least one flood per
year will reach x% of global land area (xx that of today's world).

> **Figure showing the land area affected by floods**

> Today the percentage of the population exposed to landslides annually
accounts for x% of the world population (x million people). In the
RCP2.6 scenario this share will increase xx with respect to the
pre-industrial times (and become equivalent to x million people or x% of
the global population). The largest increase, however, occurs, in the
RCP6.0 scenario, where the fraction of the population exposed will
multiply by a factor of x (reaching x million people or x% of the global
population).

### Limitations and knowledge gaps

\[A list of the main limitations and knowledge gaps e.g. bullet points
with a short explanation\]

*E.g. Limitations of global hydrological models (model evaluation type of
study)*

> ### Limited coverage of the observations available

> The study was conducted with data that covers only 19.8% of the total
global land. For large parts of the world, including sub-Saharan Africa
(except for southern Africa), Middle East, South Asia, and Southeast
Asia, the lack of data impedes evaluating the performance of
hydrological models. Given that some of these areas are also among the
most populated ones, it becomes crucial to improve the data collection
and sharing programs in these parts of the world.

> ### Limited understanding on how each human impact parameters influences model performance

> Despite the fact that including human impact parameters has a positive
effect on the performance of global hydrological models, this study does
not allow a systematic assessment of specific cause--effect relations
between how every human impact parameter here considered improves the
model performance. This hasn't been done because it is computationally
very expensive, but it would definitively help to improve and adapt
single models.

> ### Temporal and spatial resolution gaps

> The simulations here considered are based on monthly discharge records,
while the assessment of availability, demands and water-related risks
needs can change daily, and global models will benefit from improving
the temporal resolution to daily-scale. The spatial scale is also coarse
at the moment, since the simulation units (grid cells) are 0.5◦ × 0.5◦
(∼50 km× 50 km at the equator) which translates into modeling capacities
restricted to basins with a minimum size of 9,000km^2.^ Improved spatial
resolution might also improve model performance in catchments e of
smaller size and eventually global models might be more suited e.g. for
national water planning.

> ### Data

> Observed monthly river discharge data was taken from the Global Runoff
Data Centre (GRDC). From the 9051 gauging stations in the GRDC database,
selected stations have to meet the following criteria: (1) a minimum of
5 years' coverage (not necessarily consecutive) during the period 1971--
2010 with a completeness of observations of ≥95%; and (2) a minimum
catchment area of 9000 km2.

> The aforementioned steps resulted in 471 stations with a total
catchment area covering 19.8% of the global land. 92 out of the 471 are
gauge stations located at the outlet of the catchments. The mean length
of observations is 32.8 years for all stations. Of all the stations, 226
are located in managed and 245 in near-natural catchments. Of the
stations located at the outlet of a catchment, 45 are managed (4.8% of
the global land area) and 47 are near-natural (15.1% of the global land
area).

> ### Global impact models

> We used a modeled monthly discharge (0.5◦ × 0.5◦ spatial resolution)
for the period 1971--2010 from five state-of-the-art global hydrological
models:
[[H08]](https://www.isimip.org/impactmodels/details/52/),
[[LPJmL,]](https://www.isimip.org/impactmodels/details/80/)
,
[[MATSIRO]](https://www.isimip.org/impactmodels/details/91/)
,
[[PCR-GLOBWB]](https://www.isimip.org/impactmodels/details/104/),
and
[[WaterGAP2]](https://www.isimip.org/impactmodels/details/134/)
. All model simulations were carried out under the modeling framework of
phase 2a of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project
(ISIMIP2a: www.isimip.org/protocol/\#isimip2a). For each model, we used
two simulations: (1) HIP: a model run including time-varying land use
and land cover change, historical dam construction and operation,
irrigation and upstream consumptive water abstractions; and (2)NOHIP: a
'naturalized' model run without HIP. An overview of the model
characteristics of each of the GHMs, and the methods used to
parameterize hydrological processes and human impact, can be found in
[[supplementary table 1 of the published
paper]](https://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/13/5/055008/media/ERL_13_055008_SD.pdf).*
